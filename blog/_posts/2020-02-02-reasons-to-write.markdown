_Note: This first blog post is a reminder to myself as to why I have decided to write a blog. I hope it's helpful to other people here also!_

I have been meaning to start writing a blog for some time and finally this is the first post! My [SMART goal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria) is to publish a post every other week. My reasons to write are:

👶🏻 _For my past self_: To share things that I have learnt with the developer community, especially when I tried to find an article to help me and didn't find exactly what I needed.

👩🏻‍💻 _For my present self_: If you cannot explain something, you do not understand. Although it's [uncertain who actually said this](https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/8742/did-einstein-say-if-you-cant-explain-it-simply-you-dont-understand-it-well-en) this quote definitely resonates. I learn better when actively taking notes and trying to explain things rather than simply reading. I hope that by explaining to others, I also benefit myself indirectly. 

👵🏻 _For my future self_: As developers we are constantly learning, and only a finite amount of information can actually fit into a single brain. I want to write so that my future self can refer back to what I have written and easily relearn what I had learnt in the past. 

I've made a conscious effort here to have the goals focus on myself and what I can control (known as [process goals](https://alifeofproductivity.com/creativity-set-process-goals/
)), rather than who or how many people read my posts or other "success" factors, because even if no one reads what I write, the writing itself is worth it.

If you're interested in even more motivational words, I was super inspired by:
- [Alexandra White - Technically Speaking: improve your code with documentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nomw8qlGIM8) to finally start writing and define my "why", and
- [Practicing Developer's A Dozen Ways to Make Time](https://dev.to/practicingdev/a-dozen-ways-to-make-time-2c5m) to actually make the time to do it (this post was written in the small moments of my week in between doing other things).
